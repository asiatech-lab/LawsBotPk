# Background Image Instructions

## To get the exact background from your uploaded image:

1. **Save your uploaded image** as `background.jpg` or `background.png`
2. **Place it in** `public/images/background.jpg`
3. **The code will automatically use it**

## Alternative: Use a legal-themed background

If you want a similar legal theme, you can:
- Search for "Supreme Court Pakistan" images
- Search for "Lady Justice statue" images  
- Combine them or use a single legal-themed background

## Current Setup

The code is ready to use your local image. Just place your background image in:
`public/images/background.jpg`

The component will automatically detect and use it.
